# Cifar-10-Cnn
n this project, I successfully designed and trained a high-performing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Through meticulous hyperparameter tuning and advanced techniques, I achieved outstanding results, demonstrating my expertise in deep learning and computer vision.
